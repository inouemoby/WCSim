# - BGO Placement: Default in source code is false. If set to true, you'll place the BGO inside
# the detector geometry at (0,0,0) position. This is only supported if you use ambeevt generator
# so you can see the tag scintillation light for the AmBe source.
#/WCSim/BGOPlacement true
# Note that /WCSim/BGOPlacement *must* be set before /WCSim/Construct

# - /WCSim/SaveCapture & /process/inactivate nKiller: Default not set.
# Also specially needed for AmBe calibration. The first command makes sure the Capture processes
# are being saved. The second one ensures Geant4 is not killing neutrons too early in the run,
# so we can have neutronCapture at any time in the run.
# Note that the nKiller process is not defined in the FTFP_BERT_HP
#  (can be turned on via /WCSim/physics/list FTFP_BERT_HP in jobOptions.mac)
# and so will cause a fatal crash.
# When using FTFP_BERT_HP, neutrons are not killed and so you just have
# to set /WCSim/SaveCapture true
#/WCSim/SaveCapture true
#/process/inactivate nKiller

# 1. Downland the CDS CAD model from WCTE webpage (https://wcte.hyperk.ca/wg/calibration/cds-system/cds-arm-cad-for-physics-simulation/arm-for-simulation-ascii-v2.zip/view), unzip it and set the path

#Added for the PMT QE option 08/17/10 (XQ)
# 1. Stacking only mean when the photon is generated
# the QE is applied to reduce the total number of photons
# 2. Stacking and sensitivity detector
# In the stacking part, the maximum QE is applied to reduce
# the total number of photons
# On the detector side, the rest of QE are applied according to QE/QE_max
# distribution. This option is in particular important for the WLS
# 3. The third option means all the QE are applied at the detector
# Good for the low energy running.
# 4. Switch off the QE, ie. set it at 100%

# - 7.7 MeV 8%  of the time.
# - 0.0 MeV 26% of the time.
# Neutron Energy is taken from a simulated realistic AmBe Spectrum depending on the Gamma Energy.
# In order to run this correctly, the AmBe source must be in the geometry & neutron capture must be activated - for details see the "AmBe CALIBRATION SOURCE" section above

# TRACKING
##################
## Commands to control which true particle tracks are tracked and saved to the output file:
## By default, save all tracks in the chain from primaries to those that produce Cherenkov photons that produce hits
## To disable this behaviour and only save tracks of particular creation processes and particle types, set to false
/Tracking/saveHitProducingTracks true
## By default, all electrons, muons, pions, kaons, protons and neutrons are saved, and particles created by Decay, conv,
## nCapture or OpWLS processes
## Add additional PDG codes of particle types or additional Geant4 process names of creation processes of tracks to save
## Note that optical photons have PDG code 0 in Geant4
#/Tracking/trackParticle 0
#/Tracking/trackProcess Cerenkov
## Due to the typically very large number of optical photons, a fraction can be tracked by setting the percentage to randomly draw
## Note that the value is a percentage from 0.0 to 100.0, not fraction 0.0 to 1.0
/Tracking/fractionOpticalPhotonsToDraw 0.0

## change the name of the output root file, default = wcsim.root
/WCSimIO/RootFile wcsim.root

## Boolean to select whether to save the NEUT RooTracker vertices in the output file, provided you used
## a NEUT vector file as input
/WCSimIO/SaveRooTracker 0

## set a timer running on WCSimRunAction
#/WCSimIO/Timer false
